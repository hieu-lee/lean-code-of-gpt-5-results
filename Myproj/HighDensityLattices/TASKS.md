# Context
- Goal: formalize the abundance of high-density lattices statement from `chosen_sphere_result.json` within Lean.
- Proof ingredients: high-density seed lattice, scaling via diagonal matrices, Voronoi second moment control, and counting a grid of parameters.

# What Matters Most
- Capture all external theorems as axioms with precise citations and general statements.
- Keep each Lean file short (<250 lines) and modular.
- Run `lake build` after major edits to ensure the project still compiles.

# TODO
- [x] Draft the lattice-specific axioms (existence, scaling, Voronoi bounds, discreteness) with sources noted.
- [ ] Introduce helper definitions for the diagonal grid and parameter bounds.
- [x] Formalize the main theorem mirroring the given proof structure.
- [x] Verify the new module with `lake build` and record any issues encountered.
