## Context
- Goal: formalize `thm_firoozbakht_cyclics_3.tex` leveraging Pollack's analytic bounds.
- We rely on project-level axioms summarizing the asymptotic estimates.

## Priorities
- Capture the LaTeX structure via Lean modules with short files.
- Use existing axioms to keep the proof lightweight and maintainability high.
- Ensure the statement matches the exponent inequality after rewriting logs.

## Upcoming Tasks
- [x] Record the ratio axiom and log lower bound needed for the proof skeleton.
- [x] Construct the Lean file importing the new axiom and rewriting via `Real.rpow`.
- [x] Register the theorem in `Myproj.lean` and verify with `lake build`.
- [x] Review documentation/comments for clarity in future passes (module docstring added).
