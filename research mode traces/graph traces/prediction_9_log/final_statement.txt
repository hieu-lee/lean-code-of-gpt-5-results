There do not exist a universal constant $C>0$ and a function $g$ with $\sup_\Delta g(\Delta)>C$ such that for every graph $G=C_n\sqcup K_{1,\Delta}$ and every initial weighting $\omega:E(G)\to\{1,2,3\}$ that assigns weight $2$ to every edge of the cycle $C_n$, if Stage 2 resamples exactly the edges in $\operatorname{Bad}_1(\omega)$, then the expected number resampled is at most $C\,|E(G)|/g(\Delta)$.
