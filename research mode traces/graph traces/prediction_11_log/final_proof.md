Proof. Fix any $\varepsilon_0\in(0,1/6]$. Let $G=K_3$, so $n=3$ and $\delta(G)=2\ge (1/2+\varepsilon_0)\cdot 3$. Let $F=\emptyset$.

Assume, for a contradiction, that $G-F=K_3$ admits an NSD 3-edge-weighting that is 1-locally-reconfigurable. By definition, the NSD reconfiguration graph $R_3(H)$ has as vertices the NSD 3-edge-weightings of $H$, with two vertices adjacent exactly when the weightings differ on one edge; an NSD 3-edge-weighting is 1-locally-reconfigurable iff its vertex has positive degree in $R_3(H)$. It is known that $R_3(K_3)$ is edgeless on 6 vertices. Hence every NSD 3-edge-weighting of $K_3$ has degree 0 in $R_3(K_3)$, contradicting the assumed 1-local reconfigurability. Therefore $G-F$ admits no 1-locally-reconfigurable NSD 3-edge-weighting, as claimed.
