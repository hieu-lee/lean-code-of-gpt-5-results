Assume for contradiction that there exists β>0 such that for every pair of graphs (G,H) and every edge‑weighting ω:E(X)→{1,3} of X:=G□H, the graph X has at least β·min{|E(G)|,|E(H)|}·max{|V(G)|,|V(H)|} edges uv with |s_ω(u)−s_ω(v)|≤1.

Let G=K_{1,Δ_G} with center g₀ and H=K_{1,Δ_H} with center h₀, where Δ_G,Δ_H≥1. Construct a {1,3}–edge–weighting ω as follows.
- For each h∈V(H), assign weight a(h) to every G–edge in the G–layer G×{h} by a(h₀)=3 and a(h)=1 for h≠h₀.
- For each g∈V(G), assign weight b(g) to every H–edge in the H–layer {g}×H by b(g₀)=3 and b(g)=1 for g≠g₀.

For u=(g,h)∈V(X), the weighted degree splits into contributions from G–edges and H–edges:
$$s_ω(g,h)=\deg_G(g)\,a(h)+\deg_H(h)\,b(g).$$
Since G and H are stars, \deg_G(g₀)=Δ_G, \deg_G(g)=1 for g≠g₀, \deg_H(h₀)=Δ_H, and \deg_H(h)=1 for h≠h₀. Hence
\[
\begin{aligned}
s_ω(g₀,h₀)&=3Δ_G+3Δ_H,\\
s_ω(g₀,h)&=Δ_G+3 && (h\ne h₀),\\
s_ω(g,h₀)&=Δ_H+3 && (g\ne g₀),\\
s_ω(g,h)&=2 && (g\ne g₀,\ h\ne h₀).
\end{aligned}
\]
We now check edge differences in X.

1) G–edges: these are between (g₀,h) and (g,h) with g≠g₀ fixed and h∈V(H).
- If h≠h₀, then |s_ω(g₀,h)−s_ω(g,h)|=(Δ_G+3)−2=Δ_G+1≥2 (since Δ_G≥1).
- If h=h₀, then |s_ω(g₀,h₀)−s_ω(g,h₀)|=(3Δ_G+3Δ_H)−(Δ_H+3)=3Δ_G+2Δ_H−3≥2 (since Δ_G,Δ_H≥1).

2) H–edges: these are between (g,h₀) and (g,h) with h≠h₀ fixed and g∈V(G).
- If g≠g₀, then |s_ω(g,h₀)−s_ω(g,h)|=(Δ_H+3)−2=Δ_H+1≥2 (since Δ_H≥1).
- If g=g₀, then |s_ω(g₀,h₀)−s_ω(g₀,h)|=(3Δ_G+3Δ_H)−(Δ_G+3)=2Δ_G+3Δ_H−3≥2 (since Δ_G,Δ_H≥1).

Thus every edge uv of X satisfies |s_ω(u)−s_ω(v)|≥2, so |Bad₁(ω)|=0, where Bad₁(ω) denotes the set of edges with |s_ω(u)−s_ω(v)|≤1. For stars we also have |E(G)|=Δ_G, |E(H)|=Δ_H, |V(G)|=Δ_G+1, and |V(H)|=Δ_H+1; hence
$$\min\{|E(G)|,|E(H)|\}\,\max\{|V(G)|,|V(H)|\}\ge 1\cdot 2=2,$$
so
$$0=|Bad₁(ω)|<β\,\min\{|E(G)|,|E(H)|\}\,\max\{|V(G)|,|V(H)|\},$$
contradicting the assumed universal lower bound for all {1,3}–edge–weightings of G□H. Therefore, no such absolute β>0 exists.
