Conjecture 7 (Product obstruction is pervasive). There exists an absolute β>0 such that for every pair of graphs (G,H) with sufficiently large maximum degrees, every 3-edge-weighting of G□H has at least β·min{|E(G)|,|E(H)|}·max{|V(G)|,|V(H)|} edges with |s(u)−s(v)|≤1. Equivalently, θ_{Δ}(G□H)≥β for all such pairs, extending the existence of pairs with θ_{Δ}≥1/4 to a universal lower bound.
