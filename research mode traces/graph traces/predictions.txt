  "Conjecture 1 (Universal 2/3-fraction strong separation). There exists an absolute ε_0=1/3 such that every nice graph G admits a 3-edge-weighting ω with |Bad_1(ω)|≤ε_0|E(G)|. Equivalently, every nice G has an ℓ-slack NSD 3-edge-weighting with ℓ=1 on at least a 2/3-fraction of its edges, and this is tight already for G=C_3.",
  "Conjecture 2 (Layer-doubling amplifies small-difference edges). There exists an absolute c>0 such that for every graph G with sufficiently large maximum degree, one has θ_{Δ}(K_2□G)≥max{θ_{Δ}(G),c}. In particular, there is a universal c such that every 3-edge-weighting of K_2□G leaves at least a c-fraction of edges with |s(u)−s(v)|≤1, regardless of G.",
  "Conjecture 3 (Reconfiguration connectivity for trees). For every tree T on at least 3 vertices, the NSD reconfiguration graph R_3(T) is connected and has diameter O(|E(T)|). Moreover, NSD 3-edge-weightings are 1-locally-reconfigurable on trees.",
  "Conjecture 4 (Near-parity surjectivity on bipartite graphs under 3-weights). Let G be connected and bipartite with bipartition (A,B). Among the four parity profiles (parity sums on A and B), exactly two occur for some NSD 3-edge-weighting of G, and these two profiles differ by flipping all parities in one side. Moreover, both profiles occur unless G is a tree with |A| odd and |B| odd, in which case neither occurs.",
  "Conjecture 5 (Triangle-sparse graphs admit global 2-slack after deleting o(|E|) edges). For every ε>0 there exists δ=δ(ε)>0 such that every nice triangle-sparse graph G admits a set F⊆E(G) with |F|≤ε|E(G)| so that G−F has an ℓ-slack NSD 3-edge-weighting with ℓ=1 (i.e., |s(u)−s(v)|≥2 on all edges of G−F).",
  "Conjecture 6 (Threshold for random subgraphs of high-degree hosts). There exists an absolute c>0 such that for every family of nice graphs G with Δ(G)→∞ and |V(G)|≤Δ(G)^{O(1)}, if p≥c·(logΔ(G))/Δ(G), then a.a.s. G_p is nice and hence admits an NSD 3-edge-weighting.",
  "Conjecture 7 (Product obstruction is pervasive). There exists an absolute β>0 such that for every pair of graphs (G,H) with sufficiently large maximum degrees, every 3-edge-weighting of G□H has at least β·min{|E(G)|,|E(H)|}·max{|V(G)|,|V(H)|} edges with |s(u)−s(v)|≤1. Equivalently, θ_{Δ}(G□H)≥β for all such pairs, extending the existence of pairs with θ_{Δ}≥1/4 to a universal lower bound.",
  "Conjecture 8 (List-NSD robustness under sparse 2-lists). There exists an absolute α∈(0,1) such that the following holds for all sufficiently large Δ: for every nice graph G with Δ(G)=Δ and every α-dense list assignment L:E(G)→2^{\\{1,2,3\\}} (i.e., at most an α-fraction of edges around any vertex have 2-lists, all others have 3-lists), there is a list NSD 3-edge-weighting from L.",
  "Conjecture 9 (Quantitative strong edge-separation in K_n). There exists an absolute γ>0 such that for all n sufficiently large, every 3-edge-weighting ω of K_n satisfies |Bad_1(ω)|≥γ·n^2. Moreover, the extremal order n^2 is tight up to constants.",
  "Conjecture 10 (NSD reconfiguration expansion in expanders). There exists c>0 such that if G is a d-regular expander on n vertices with spectral gap at least c and n sufficiently large, then R_3(G) is connected and has diameter at most n^{O(1)}, and furthermore the simple “single-edge resampling” Markov chain on R_3(G) is rapidly mixing (polynomial mixing time).",
  "Conjecture 11 (Arboricity deletion at the sharp threshold). There exists C_0>0 such that for every ε>0 there are graphs G with arbitrarily large Δ(G) for which the following holds: deleting any subgraph F with arb(F)≤(C_0−ε) does not guarantee that G−F admits an NSD 3-edge-weighting, while deleting some F with arb(F)≤(C_0+ε) always suffices. In particular, the constant in the known positive arboricity-deletion theorem is optimal up to ε.",
  "Conjecture 12 (Bipartite two-phase correction with tolerance-1 succeeds). There exists a universal C>0 and an unbounded function g such that for every graph G=C_n⊔K_{1,Δ} and every initial weighting ω:E(G)→{1,2,3}, if Stage 2 resamples the edges in Bad_1(ω) (instead of Bad_2(ω)), then the expected number resampled is at most C·|E(G)|/g(Δ).",
  "Conjecture 13 (Minimal local obstruction to NSD-3 in high girth). There exists g_0 such that for every nice graph G with girth at least g_0, every 3-edge-weighting ω with |Bad(ω)| minimized among all 3-edge-weightings satisfies that Bad(ω) is a matching. Equivalently, in high-girth graphs the only unavoidable equal-sum edges can be made pairwise disjoint.",
  "Conjecture 14 (Sparse robust NSD in dense host graphs). For every ε>0 there exists C=C(ε)>0 such that for every n-vertex graph G with δ(G)≥(1/2+ε)n and every subgraph F⊆G with arb(F)≤C and Δ(F)≤C·log n, the graph G−F admits an NSD 3-edge-weighting that is 1-locally-reconfigurable."
