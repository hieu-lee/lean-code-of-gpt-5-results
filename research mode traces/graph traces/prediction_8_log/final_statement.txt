There is no absolute c>0 such that every sufficiently large d-regular expander G with adjacency spectral gap at least c has connected R_3(G) and a rapidly mixing single-edge resampling Markov chain on R_3(G). More precisely, for every c>0 there exist a fixed degree d and infinitely many d-regular expanders G with adjacency spectral gap at least c for which R_3(G) is disconnected; consequently the single-edge resampling chain on R_3(G) is not irreducible (hence not rapidly mixing).
