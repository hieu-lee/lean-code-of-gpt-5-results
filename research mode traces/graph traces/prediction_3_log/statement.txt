Conjecture 4 (Near-parity surjectivity on bipartite graphs under 3-weights). Let G be connected and bipartite with bipartition (A,B). Among the four parity profiles (parity sums on A and B), exactly two occur for some NSD 3-edge-weighting of G, and these two profiles differ by flipping all parities in one side. Moreover, both profiles occur unless G is a tree with |A| odd and |B| odd, in which case neither occurs.
