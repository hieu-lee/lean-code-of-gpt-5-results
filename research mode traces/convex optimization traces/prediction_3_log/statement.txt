(Implicit step convexifies the discrete curve.) Let f be convex and L-smooth. For the implicit (backward Euler) method x_{n+1}=x_n-\eta\nabla f(x_{n+1}) with any \eta>0, the sequence n\mapsto f(x_n) is convex: \delta_n\ge 0 for all n. Moreover, if f is \mu-strongly convex, then (\Delta_n) is strictly decreasing unless x_n is optimal.
