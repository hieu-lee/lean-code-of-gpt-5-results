Let f: \mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R} be convex and differentiable, and fix any stepsize \eta>0. Define the explicit and implicit iterates by \(x_{n+1}=x_n-\eta\nabla f(x_n)\) and \(z_{n+1}=z_n-\eta\nabla f(z_{n+1})\) with arbitrary initial points \(x_0,z_0\), and set \(c_n:=\tfrac12\big(f(x_n)+f(z_n)\big)\). Then the sequence \(n\mapsto c_n\) is convex, i.e., \(c_{n+2}-2c_{n+1}+c_n\ge 0\) for all \(n\).
