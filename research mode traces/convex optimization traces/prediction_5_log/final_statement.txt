Nonexistence of a universal convexity threshold for the Moreau-smoothed evaluation along GD. Let L>0 and let $\theta\in(1.75,2)$ with step size $\eta=\theta/L$. There is no positive universal threshold $\bar\gamma(\theta)$ (independent of $f$ and of the initialization) such that, for every convex $L$-smooth $f$, every initialization $x_0$, and every $\gamma\in(0,\bar\gamma(\theta)]$, the sequence $n\mapsto e_\gamma(f)(x_n^{\rm GD})$ (with $x_{n+1}=x_n-\eta\nabla f(x_n)$) is convex in $n$. In particular, the scaling $\bar\gamma(\theta)=\Theta((2-\theta)/L)$ as $\theta\uparrow2$ is impossible.
