(Lookahead with small pull guarantees convexity.) Let f be convex and L-smooth. Consider lookahead with inner GD step-size \eta\in(0,2/L] and outer parameters k\in\mathbb{N}, \alpha\in(0,\bar\alpha(\theta,k)] with z_{t+1}=(1-\alpha)z_t+\alpha x_{t,k}, where x_{t,0}=z_t and x_{t,j+1}=x_{t,j}-\eta\nabla f(x_{t,j}). There exists \bar\alpha(\theta,k)>0 with \bar\alpha(\theta,k)=\Theta\!\big((2-\theta)/k\big) as \theta\uparrow2 such that t\mapsto f(z_t) is convex for every convex L-smooth f and initialization.
