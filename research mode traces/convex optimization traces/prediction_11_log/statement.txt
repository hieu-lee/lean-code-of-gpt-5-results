(Diagonal preconditioning criterion.) Let f be convex and coordinate-wise L_i-smooth (i.e., \partial_i\nabla f is L_i-Lipschitz). Consider preconditioned GD x_{n+1}=x_n-D\nabla f(x_n) with diagonal D=\operatorname{diag}(d_i), d_i>0, and define \Theta:=\max_i L_i d_i. If \Theta\in(0,1.75], then for every convex coordinate-wise smooth f and any initialization, the optimization curve n\mapsto f(x_n) is convex; furthermore, for every \Theta\in(1.75,2), there exist convex coordinate-wise smooth f and initializations where convexity fails even though f(x_n)\searrow f_*.
