Bounded–eccentricity Klartag ellipsoids. There exist absolute c,C>0 such that for every n≥2 there is an origin-symmetric ellipsoid 𝔈⊂R^n with vol_n(𝔈) ≥ c n^{2}, 𝔈∩(Z^n\{0})=∅, and condition number κ(𝔈) ≤ n^{C}. Equivalently, the lattice packing realizing density ≥ c n^{2} 2^{-n} can be chosen to arise from an integer–free ellipsoid whose axis ratios are bounded by a fixed polynomial in n.
