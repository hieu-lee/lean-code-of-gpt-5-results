Abundance of high-density lattices. There exist absolute constants c, C > 0 such that for all sufficiently large n there are at least exp(c n \log n) pairwise non–SL_n(\mathbb{Z})–equivalent unimodular lattices L with $\Delta(L) \ge c\, n^{2} 2^{-n}$ and $\frac{1}{\operatorname{vol}_n(V(L))} \int_{V(L)} \|x\|^2\,dx \le C n$.
