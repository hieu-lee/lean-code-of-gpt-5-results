Conventions used throughout (for fixed dimension n∈ℕ):
- Euclidean space ℝ^n with norm ∥·∥; closed ball B_n(x,r):={y∈ℝ^n: ∥y−x∥≤r}.
- Lebesgue n–volume vol_n(·); unit-ball volume ω_n:=vol_n(B_n(0,1)).
- A lattice L⊂ℝ^n is full rank with covolume det(L); minimum λ(L):=min{∥v∥: v∈L\{0}}.
- Lattice packing by balls of radius r≤λ(L)/2 has density Δ(L,r)=ω_n r^n/det(L).
- The optimal (asymptotic) packing density in dimension n is θ(n):=sup over all sphere packings of their upper asymptotic density (equivalently, supremum over periodic packings).
- Absolute constant: a positive numerical constant independent of n. Asymptotics: o(1)→0 as n→∞; f(n)∼g(n) means f/g→1.
