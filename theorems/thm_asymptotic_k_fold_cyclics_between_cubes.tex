\begin{theorem}[Asymptotic k-fold cyclics between cubes (disproves Conj.~35 of \cite{Cohen2025})]\label{thm:asymptotic_k_fold_cyclics_between_cubes}
Let $A_h(N)$ denote the number of cyclic pairs separated by $h\in\{2,4,6\}$ in the interval $(N^3,(N+1)^3]$. There is no regularly varying function $f\in RV_\rho$ with index $\rho\in(2,5/2]$ such that $A_h(N)\sim f(N)$ as $N\to\infty$. In particular, the claimed index range $[1,5/2]$ is invalid; any valid RV asymptotic must have $\rho\le 2$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
$$
I_N:=(N^3,(N+1)^3],\qquad A_h(N):=\#\{n\in I_N:\ \gcd(n,\varphi(n))=\gcd(n+h,\varphi(n+h))=1\}.
$$
For every $N\ge 1$,
$$
|I_N|=(N+1)^3-N^3=3N^2+3N+1\le 4N^2,
$$
so trivially
$$
0\le A_h(N)\le |I_N|\le 4N^2. \tag{1}
$$
Assume toward a contradiction that there exists a regularly varying $f\in RV_\rho$ with index $\rho\in(2,5/2]$ such that $A_h(N)\sim f(N)$ as $N\to\infty$. By definition of regular variation, there is a slowly varying, eventually positive function $L$ with
$$
f(N)=N^{\rho}L(N). \tag{2}
$$
Using (1) and the asymptotic $A_h(N)\sim f(N)>0$, for all sufficiently large $N$ we have
$$
N^{\rho}L(N)=f(N)\le 2A_h(N)\le 8N^2,
$$
whence
$$
L(N)\le 8\,N^{2-\rho}\qquad(N\ge N_0). \tag{3}
$$
Choose $\varepsilon:=\tfrac{\rho-2}{2}>0$. Then for $N\ge N_0$,
$$
N^{\varepsilon}L(N)\le 8\,N^{\varepsilon+2-\rho}=8\,N^{-\varepsilon}\xrightarrow[N\to\infty]{}0. \tag{4}
$$
This contradicts the standard property of slowly varying functions (see, e.g., \cite{BGT1989}): if $L$ is slowly varying and eventually positive, then for every $\varepsilon>0$ one has $N^{\varepsilon}L(N)\to\infty$ as $N\to\infty$.

Therefore no such $f\in RV_\rho$ with $\rho\in(2,5/2]$ can satisfy $A_h(N)\sim f(N)$. Since $h\in\{2,4,6\}$ was arbitrary, the only potentially admissible indices for any regularly varying asymptotic $A_h(N)\sim f(N)$ must satisfy $\rho\le 2$. In particular, the upper endpoint $5/2$ asserted in the range $[1,5/2]$ is not admissible. 
\end{proof}
