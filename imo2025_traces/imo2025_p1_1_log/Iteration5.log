**Claim.** For every integer $n\ge 3$, the possible values of $k\in\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ for which there exist $n$ distinct lines covering all integer points $(a,b)$ with $a,b\ge1$, $a+b\le n+1$, and with exactly $k$ sunny lines (not parallel to the $x$–axis, the $y$–axis, or the line $x+y=0$) are exactly
$$k\in\{0,1,3\}.$$ 

**Proof.** For $m\in\mathbb N$ write
$$\mathcal T_m:=\{(a,b)\in\mathbb Z^2:\ a,b\ge1,\ a+b\le m+1\}$$
and for $r\in\mathbb Z$ set $D_r:=\{(a,b)\in\mathbb Z^2:a+b=r\}$.

1) Existence for $k\in\{0,1,3\}$.
- $k=0$: take the $n$ anti-diagonals $D_2,D_3,\dots,D_{n+1}$.
- $k=1$: take $D_3,\dots,D_{n+1}$ together with the sunny line $y=x$.
- $k=3$: take $D_5,\dots,D_{n+1}$ and the three sunny lines $y=x$, $y=-2x+5$, $y=-\tfrac12x+\tfrac52$, which cover precisely $\mathcal T_3=D_2\cup D_3\cup D_4$.

2) A sharp intersection bound inside $\mathcal T_m$.

Lemma 1. Let $m\ge1$. Any sunny line $\ell$ meets $\mathcal T_m$ in at most $\big\lfloor\tfrac{m+1}2\big\rfloor$ lattice points. Moreover, if $m\ge3$ is odd, the only sunny lines meeting $\mathcal T_m$ in exactly $\tfrac{m+1}2$ lattice points are
$$y=x,\qquad y=-2x+(m+2),\qquad y=-\tfrac12x+\tfrac{m+2}2.$$

Proof. If $\ell$ contains at most one lattice point in $\mathcal T_m$ the bound is trivial. Otherwise $\ell$ has a primitive lattice direction $(u,v)$ with $\gcd(u,v)=1$, so its lattice points form $(a,b)=(a_0,b_0)+t(u,v)$, $t\in\mathbb Z$, and the sum $s=a+b$ progresses by the constant increment $\Delta:=u+v\ne0$ (non-sunny would allow $\Delta=0$). The admissible sums in $\mathcal T_m$ are $2,3,\dots,m+1$.
- If $|\Delta|\ge3$, among $m$ consecutive sums there are at most $\lceil m/|\Delta|\rceil\le\lceil m/3\rceil\le\lfloor\tfrac{m+1}2\rfloor$ hits.
- If $|\Delta|=2$, the sums have fixed parity, so there are at most $\lceil m/2\rceil=\lfloor\tfrac{m+1}2\rfloor$ hits.
- If $|\Delta|=1$, then (up to symmetry) the primitive direction is $(p,1-p)$ with $p\in\mathbb Z$, $p\ge2$. Writing the line as $y=-(p-1)x/p+\beta$, the integer points on it have $x\equiv r\pmod p$, hence within $1\le x\le m$ there are at most $\lceil m/p\rceil\le\lceil m/2\rceil=\lfloor\tfrac{m+1}2\rfloor$ points. This gives the universal bound.
For $m=2t+1\ge3$, a direct optimization over the slope families $+1$, $-2$, $-\tfrac12$, $|\Delta|=2$ with slope $\ne+1$, $|\Delta|\ge3$, and $|\Delta|=1$ with $p\ge3$ shows that only the three listed lines achieve $t+1=(m+1)/2$, each uniquely in its family. ∎

Corollary 2. For $m\ge4$, the set $\mathcal T_m$ cannot be covered by $m$ sunny lines. For $m=2$ this is also impossible, while $m=1$ and $m=3$ are possible.

Proof. The cases $m=1,3$ are realized in step 1. For $m=2$, the three points cannot be covered by two sunny lines since $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ lie on slope $-1$. For $m=2t\ge4$, each sunny line meets $\mathcal T_m$ in at most $t$ points, so $m$ sunny lines cover at most $mt=2t^2<|\mathcal T_m|=2t^2+t$. For $m=2t+1\ge5$, by Lemma 1 at most three sunny lines contribute $t+1$ points each, the rest contribute $\le t$, so the total $\le3(t+1)+(m-3)t=2t^2+t+3<2t^2+3t+1=|\mathcal T_m|$. ∎

3) A universal demand bound on sunny lines.

Let a covering of $\mathcal T_n$ be given by $n$ lines with exactly $k$ sunny lines; among the remaining $n-k$ non-sunny lines, let $h,v,d$ be the numbers of horizontals, verticals, and anti-diagonals, with $h+v+d=n-k$. For each $r\in\{2,\dots,n+1\}$, if $D_r$ is not among the chosen $d$ anti-diagonals then the $h+v$ horizontal/vertical lines meet $D_r$ in at most $h+v$ points, so at least $\max\{0,(r-1)-(h+v)\}$ points of $D_r$ must be supplied by sunny lines. Summing over $r$ after choosing the $d$ anti-diagonals to be those with largest $r$ (which minimizes the total demand) yields the universal lower bound
$$\text{(total points forced onto sunny lines)}\ \ge\ \frac{k(k+1)}2.$$

4) Peeling by degree: forced factors on anti-diagonals, rows and columns.

We now convert any covering into a canonical core where only the $k$ sunny lines remain, and they cover a translate of $\mathcal T_k$.

Lemma 3 (anti-diagonal forcing). Let $L_1,\dots,L_N$ be distinct lines, and set $P(x,y):=\prod_{i=1}^N L_i(x,y)$. If $P$ vanishes on $\mathcal T_N$, then letting $d$ be the number of anti-diagonal factors among the $L_i$, with $m:=N-d$, the anti-diagonals $x+y=r$ for all $r\in\{m+2,\dots,N+1\}$ must be among the $L_i$. Moreover, after dividing $P$ by $\prod_{r=m+2}^{N+1}(x+y-r)$ one gets a product $P_1$ of $m$ lines that vanishes on $\mathcal T_m$.

Proof. For fixed $r$, consider $x\mapsto P(x,r-x)$. Every factor except the anti-diagonals contributes degree $1$ in $x$, hence $\deg_x P(x,r-x)=N-d=m$. Since $P$ vanishes on $\{(x,r-x):x=1,\dots,r-1\}$, the univariate polynomial $x\mapsto P(x,r-x)$ has $r-1$ distinct integer zeros. If $r-1>m$, it must be the zero polynomial, forcing $x+y-r$ to divide $P$. This holds for all $r=m+2,\dots,N+1$. Dividing by these factors annihilates exactly the top $d$ anti-diagonals; on the remaining points with $a+b\le m+1$ the removed factors are nonzero, so the quotient still vanishes there. ∎

Lemma 4 (row/column forcing). Let a product $S$ of $M$ lines vanish on $\mathcal T_M$ and assume it has no anti-diagonal factor. Let $h$ (resp. $v$) be the number of horizontal (resp. vertical) factors in $S$ and set $p_y:=M-h$ and $p_x:=M-v$.
- If $m-b+1>p_y$, then $y=b$ divides $S$. Hence the horizontal factors of $S$ are exactly $y=1,2,\dots,h$, and after division by their product the quotient vanishes on $\{(x,y)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge1}^2: y\ge h+1,\ x+y\le M+1\}$.
- If $m-a+1>p_x$, then $x=a$ divides $S$. Hence the vertical factors are exactly $x=1,2,\dots,v$, and after division by their product the quotient vanishes on $\{(x,y)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge1}^2: x\ge v+1,\ y\ge h+1,\ x+y\le M+1\}$.

Proof. Fix $b$. Since there is no horizontal factor in $p_y$, the specialization $x\mapsto S(x,b)$ has degree $p_y$. Because $S$ vanishes on $\mathcal T_M$, we have $S(x,b)=0$ for all integers $x\in\{1,\dots,M-b+1\}$. If $M-b+1>p_y$, the univariate polynomial $S(x,b)$ has more roots than its degree, hence is $\equiv0$, forcing $y-b$ to divide $S$. Repeating for $b=1,2,\dots,h$ gives the first assertion and the vanishing of the quotient on the claimed set (division removes exactly the corresponding rows). The vertical statement is symmetric. ∎

Applying Lemma 3 to a covering of $\mathcal T_n$ by $n$ lines with $k$ sunny lines, we peel off the (forced) anti-diagonals $D_{m+2},\dots,D_{n+1}$ and obtain a product of $m:=k+h+v$ lines vanishing on $\mathcal T_m$ with no anti-diagonal factor. Then Lemma 4 peels off the $h$ horizontal factors $y=1,2,\dots,h$ and the $v$ vertical factors $x=1,2,\dots,v$, leaving precisely the product of the $k$ sunny lines, which vanishes on
$$\{(x,y)\in\mathbb Z^2:\ x\ge v+1,\ y\ge h+1,\ x+y\le m+1\}.$$
Translating by $(-v,-h)$, this is a translate of $\mathcal T_{k}$; equivalently, there exist $k$ sunny lines covering a translate of $\mathcal T_k$, and hence (by translating the lines) $\mathcal T_k$ itself is coverable by $k$ sunny lines.

5) Non-existence for $k\notin\{0,1,3\}$.

By the peeling in step 4, the existence of a configuration with exactly $k$ sunny lines for some $n\ge3$ implies that $\mathcal T_k$ is coverable by $k$ sunny lines. By Corollary 2, this is possible only for $k\in\{1,3\}$. Including the trivial case $k=0$ from step 1, we conclude that the only feasible values are $k\in\{0,1,3\}$.

Together with the constructions in step 1, this completes the classification. ∎

Decision: REJECT

Feedback (first flaw):

Lemma 1’s equality case is asserted without proof: the claim that for odd m≥3 the only sunny lines meeting T_m in exactly (m+1)/2 points are y=x, y=-2x+(m+2), and y=-(1/2)x+(m+2)/2 is justified merely by a "direct optimization" remark, with no rigorous argument; this uniqueness is crucial for Corollary 2’s bound.
