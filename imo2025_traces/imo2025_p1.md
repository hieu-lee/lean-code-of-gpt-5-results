**Claim.** For every integer $n\ge3$, the set of all $k\in\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ for which there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane that cover every integer point $(a,b)$ with $a,b\ge1$ and $a+b\le n+1$, and for which exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny (i.e., not parallel to the $x$–axis, the $y$–axis, or the line $x+y=0$), is precisely

$$\{0,1,3\}$$

**Proof.** For $m\in\mathbb N$ define
$$\mathcal T_m:=\{(a,b)\in\mathbb Z^2:\ a,b\ge1,\ a+b\le m+1\},\qquad D_r:=\{(a,b)\in\mathbb Z^2:\ a+b=r\}.$$
Note that $|\mathcal T_m|=\sum_{r=2}^{m+1}(r-1)=\tfrac{m(m+1)}2$.

1) Existence for $k\in\{0,1,3\}$.
- $k=0$: take the $n$ anti-diagonals $D_2,D_3,\dots,D_{n+1}$.
- $k=1$: take $D_3,\dots,D_{n+1}$ and add the line $y=x$, which covers $(1,1)$.
- $k=3$: the three sunny lines $y=x$, $y=-2x+5$, $y=-\tfrac12x+\tfrac52$ cover $\mathcal T_3=D_2\cup D_3\cup D_4$; adding $D_5,\dots,D_{n+1}$ yields a configuration with exactly three sunny lines.

2) A sharp intersection bound in $\mathcal T_m$.

Lemma 1. Let $m\ge1$. Any sunny line $\ell$ satisfies
$$|\ell\cap\mathcal T_m|\le\Big\lfloor\frac{m+1}{2}\Big\rfloor.$$
Moreover, if $m=2t+1\ge3$ is odd, then equality $|\ell\cap\mathcal T_m|=t+1$ holds if and only if $\ell$ is one of
$$y=x,\qquad y=-2x+(m+2),\qquad y=-\tfrac12x+\tfrac{m+2}2.$$

Proof. Write $\ell$ as $ax+by=c$ with $a,b,c\in\mathbb Z$, $\gcd(a,b)=1$. Since $\ell$ is sunny, $(a,b)\ne(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, and $a\ne b$. Its intersection with $D_r$ is
$$x=\frac{br-c}{b-a},\qquad y=\frac{c-ar}{b-a}.$$
Let $d:=|b-a|\ge1$. Then $\ell\cap D_r$ is a lattice point iff $r\equiv r_0\pmod d$ for some residue $r_0$ depending on $\ell$ (because $\gcd(b,d)=\gcd(a,d)=1$). Hence among the $m$ admissible sums $r\in\{2,\dots,m+1\}$, at most $\lceil m/d\rceil$ can yield lattice intersections.

- Case $d\ge3$. Then $|\ell\cap\mathcal T_m|\le\lceil m/3\rceil\le\lfloor(m+1)/2\rfloor$.

- Case $d=2$. By $\gcd(b-a,a)=1$ we have $a$ odd, hence $r\equiv r_0\pmod2$ is simply a parity restriction. Therefore $|\ell\cap\mathcal T_m|\le\lceil m/2\rceil=\lfloor(m+1)/2\rfloor$. If $m=2t+1$ and equality $t+1$ holds, the set of contributing $r$ must be all even values $2,4,\dots,2t+2$ (since there are $t+1$ even and only $t$ odd values in $\{2,\dots,2t+2\}$). Without loss of generality assume $b-a=2$ (the region $\mathcal T_m$ is symmetric under swapping $x,y$). Then for $r=2$ we need both
$$x=\frac{2b-c}{2}\ge1,\qquad y=\frac{c-2a}{2}\ge1,$$
which force $c\le2b-2=2a+2$ and $c\ge2a+2$, hence $c=2a+2$. For $r=2t+2$ we obtain
$$x=t(a+2)+1,\qquad y=1-at.$$
Requiring $x\ge1$ and $y\ge1$ for all $t\ge1$ gives $a\le0$ and $a\ge-2$; with $a$ odd this yields $a=-1$, i.e., $(a,b)=(-1,1)$ and $\ell:y=x$. Thus, for $d=2$ and $m$ odd, equality occurs only for $y=x$.

- Case $d=1$. Here every $r\in\{2,\dots,m+1\}$ gives a lattice intersection. Let $(u,v):=(-b,a)$ be a primitive direction vector of $\ell$, so $u+v=\pm1$. If $\max\{|u|,|v|\}\ge3$, then along the arithmetic progression of lattice points on $\ell$ the coordinate with step size at least $3$ must stay within $\{1,2,\dots,m\}$, so there are at most $\lceil m/3\rceil\le\lfloor(m+1)/2\rfloor$ points of $\ell$ inside $\mathcal T_m$. The only remaining primitive possibilities (with both coordinates nonzero to keep $\ell$ sunny) are $\pm(2,-1)$ (slope $-\tfrac12$) and $\pm(1,-2)$ (slope $-2$). For these two slopes one checks directly that
  * slope $-2$: for $\ell:y=-2x+b$ with $b\in\mathbb Z$,
  $$|\ell\cap\mathcal T_m|=\max\Big\{0,\Big\lfloor\frac{b-1}{2}\Big\rfloor-\max\{1,\,b-(m+1)\}+1\Big\}\le \Big\lfloor\frac{m+1}{2}\Big\rfloor,$$
  with equality attained at $b=m+2$;
  * slope $-\tfrac12$: for $\ell:2y=-x+b$ with $b\in\mathbb Z$, the parity constraint $x\equiv b\pmod2$ and
  $$1\le x\le B(b):=\min\{b-2,\,2m+2-b\}$$
  yield
  $$|\ell\cap\mathcal T_m|=\Big\lceil\frac{B(b)}2\Big\rceil\le\Big\lceil\frac m2\Big\rceil=\Big\lfloor\frac{m+1}{2}\Big\rfloor,$$
  with equality at $b=m+2$.

Collecting the cases gives the universal bound $|\ell\cap\mathcal T_m|\le\lfloor (m+1)/2\rfloor$. When $m=2t+1\ge3$, equality forces $d\in\{1,2\}$; the $d=2$ analysis yields $y=x$, while for $d=1$ the only possibilities are the two lines $y=-2x+(m+2)$ and $2y=-x+(m+2)$, as claimed. ∎

Corollary 2. The set $\mathcal T_m$ cannot be covered by $m$ sunny lines if $m\in\{2\}\cup\{4,5,6,\dots\}$. It can be covered by $m$ sunny lines for $m=1$ and $m=3$.

Proof. For $m=1$ choose any sunny line through $(1,1)$. For $m=3$, the three lines from part 1 cover $\mathcal T_3$. For $m=2$, the three points $(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)$ cannot be covered by two sunny lines because every line through any two of them is horizontal, vertical, or slope $-1$, none of which is sunny.
For $m=2t\ge4$, Lemma 1 gives $|\ell\cap\mathcal T_m|\le\lfloor (m+1)/2\rfloor=t$ for each sunny line $\ell$, so $m$ sunny lines cover at most $mt=2t^2<|\mathcal T_m|=2t^2+t$.
For $m=2t+1\ge5$, Lemma 1 implies that at most three sunny lines can contribute $t+1$ points each, while all others contribute at most $t$ points; hence the total is at most $3(t+1)+(m-3)t=2t^2+t+3<2t^2+3t+1=|\mathcal T_m|$. ∎

3) A universal demand bound on sunny lines.

Consider a covering of $\mathcal T_n$ by $n$ distinct lines with exactly $k$ sunny lines. Among the remaining $n-k$ non-sunny lines, let $h,v,d$ be the numbers of horizontal, vertical, and anti-diagonal lines, respectively ($h+v+d=n-k$). For each $r\in\{2,\dots,n+1\}$ not chosen among the $d$ anti-diagonals, the $h+v$ horizontal/vertical lines cover at most $h+v$ of the $r-1$ points on $D_r$, so at least $\max\{0,(r-1)-(h+v)\}$ points of $D_r$ lie on sunny lines. Choosing the $d$ largest anti-diagonals minimizes the total demand; summing over $r=2,\dots,(k+h+v)+1$ gives a lower bound
$$\text{(points forced on sunny lines)}\ge\sum_{r=2}^{(k+h+v)+1}\max\{0,(r-1)-(h+v)\}=1+2+\cdots+k=\frac{k(k+1)}2.$$

4) Peeling by degree: forcing anti-diagonals, rows, and columns.

Lemma 3 (anti-diagonal forcing). Let $L_1,\dots,L_N$ be distinct lines, and set $P(x,y):=\prod_{i=1}^N L_i(x,y)$. If $P$ vanishes on $\mathcal T_N$, then letting $d$ be the number of anti-diagonal factors among the $L_i$ and $m:=N-d$, the anti-diagonals $x+y=r$ for all $r\in\{m+2,\dots,N+1\}$ must be among the $L_i$. Moreover, after division by $\prod_{r=m+2}^{N+1}(x+y-r)$, the quotient $P_1$ is a product of $m$ lines and vanishes on $\mathcal T_m$.

Proof. For fixed $r$, the specialization $x\mapsto P(x,r-x)$ has degree $m$ (each non-anti-diagonal factor contributes degree $1$). Since $P$ vanishes at $x=1,\dots,r-1$, if $r-1>m$ the univariate polynomial $P(x,r-x)$ is identically zero, forcing $x+y-r$ to divide $P$. This holds for each $r\in\{m+2,\dots,N+1\}$. On the points with $a+b\le m+1$ the removed factors are nonzero, so the quotient still vanishes there. ∎

Lemma 4 (row/column forcing). Let a product $S$ of $M$ lines vanish on $\mathcal T_M$ and assume it has no anti-diagonal factor. Let $h$ and $v$ be the numbers of horizontal and vertical factors, and set $p_y:=M-h$, $p_x:=M-v$.
- If $M-b+1>p_y$, then $y=b$ divides $S$. Consequently the horizontal factors are exactly $y=1,2,\dots,h$, and after division the quotient vanishes on $\{(x,y)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge1}^2:\ y\ge h+1,\ x+y\le M+1\}$.
- If $M-a+1>p_x$, then $x=a$ divides $S$. Consequently the vertical factors are exactly $x=1,2,\dots,v$, and after division the quotient vanishes on $\{(x,y)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge1}^2:\ x\ge v+1,\ y\ge h+1,\ x+y\le M+1\}$.

Proof. Fix $b$. Since $S$ has no horizontal factor counted in $p_y$, the specialization $x\mapsto S(x,b)$ has degree $p_y$. Because $S$ vanishes on $\mathcal T_M$, it has roots $x=1,\dots,M-b+1$. If $M-b+1>p_y$, then $S(x,b)\equiv0$, so $y-b$ divides $S$. Repeating for $b=1,\dots,h$ yields the first assertion. The vertical statement is symmetric. ∎

Applying Lemma 3 to a covering of $\mathcal T_n$ by $n$ lines with exactly $k$ sunny lines, peel off the anti-diagonals $D_{m+2},\dots,D_{n+1}$ and obtain a product of $m:=k+h+v$ lines vanishing on $\mathcal T_m$ with no anti-diagonal factor. Then Lemma 4 peels off the $h$ horizontals $y=1,\dots,h$ and the $v$ verticals $x=1,\dots,v$, leaving precisely the product of the $k$ sunny lines, which vanishes on
$$\{(x,y)\in\mathbb Z^2:\ x\ge v+1,\ y\ge h+1,\ x+y\le m+1\}.$$
Translating by $(-v,-h)$ shows: there exist $k$ sunny lines covering $\mathcal T_k$.

5) Non-existence for $k\notin\{0,1,3\}$.

From the previous paragraph, any configuration with exactly $k$ sunny lines for some $n\ge3$ forces the existence of $k$ sunny lines covering $\mathcal T_k$. By Corollary 2 this is possible only for $k\in\{1,3\}$. Together with the trivial case $k=0$ (and the constructions in part 1), the only feasible values are $k\in\{0,1,3\}$.

This completes the classification. ∎
