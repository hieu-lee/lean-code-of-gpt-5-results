\begin{proof}
Let $f(N)$ be the sum of the three largest proper divisors of $N$. If the positive divisors of $N$ in increasing order are $1=d_1<d_2<d_3<d_4<\cdots<d_k=N$, then the three largest proper divisors are $N/d_2,\,N/d_3,\,N/d_4$, hence
$$
 f(N)=\frac{N}{d_2}+\frac{N}{d_3}+\frac{N}{d_4}=N\Bigl(\frac1{d_2}+\frac1{d_3}+\frac1{d_4}\Bigr).
$$
From this:
- If $6\mid N$ and $4\nmid N$ and $5\nmid N$, then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,6)$ and $f(N)=N$.
- If $6\mid N$ and $(4\mid N\text{ or }5\mid N)$, then $f(N)>N$ (indeed $d_4\le4$ or $d_4\le5$, so $\tfrac1{d_2}+\tfrac1{d_3}+\tfrac1{d_4}>\tfrac12+\tfrac13+\tfrac16=1$).
- If $6\nmid N$, then $f(N)<N$ (if $2\nmid N$ then $d_2\ge3,\,d_3\ge5,\,d_4\ge7$ so $\sum 1/d_i\le1/3+1/5+1/7<1$; if $2\mid N$ but $3\nmid N$, then $d_2=2,\,d_3\ge4,\,d_4\ge5$ so $\sum 1/d_i\le1/2+1/4+1/5<1$).

Claim. If $6\nmid N$, then $6\nmid f(N)$.

Proof of claim. If $2\nmid N$, then all proper divisors are odd, so the three largest proper divisors are odd and $f(N)$ is odd. If $2\mid N$ but $3\nmid N$, write $d_2=2$ and consider $d_3,d_4$.
- If $4\mid N$, then $d_3=4$, and modulo $3$ one has $1/d_2+1/d_3\equiv 2+1\equiv0$, while $d_4\not\equiv0\pmod3$, hence $1/d_2+1/d_3+1/d_4\not\equiv0\pmod3$, so $3\nmid f(N)$.
- If $4\nmid N$, then $v_2(N)=1$, so $d_3$ is odd. If $d_4=2d_3$, then $1/d_3+1/d_4\equiv \varepsilon-\varepsilon\equiv0\pmod3$, hence $1/d_2+1/d_3+1/d_4\equiv2\not\equiv0$, so $3\nmid f(N)$. If instead $d_4$ is odd, then $1/d_3+1/d_4\in\{0,\pm2\}$ modulo $3$; if it is $0$ then $f(N)\equiv N\cdot2\not\equiv0\pmod3$; if it is $\pm2$, then $f(N)\equiv N(2\pm2)\pmod3$, but here $N/2$ is odd while $N/d_3$ and $N/d_4$ are even, so $f(N)$ is odd and in particular $2\nmid f(N)$. In all cases $6\nmid f(N)$. This proves the claim. $\square$

Now consider an infinite sequence $(a_n)_{n\ge1}$ of positive integers, each having at least three proper divisors, with $a_{n+1}=f(a_n)$.

1) All terms are multiples of $6$. If $6\nmid a_1$, then by the claim we have $6\nmid a_n$ for all $n$, and by the monotonicity above $a_{n+1}<a_n$ for all $n$, which is impossible for an infinite sequence of positive integers. Thus $6\mid a_1$.

If for some $m$ one had $6\mid a_m$ but $6\nmid a_{m+1}$, then by the claim $6\nmid a_{m+i}$ for all $i\ge1$, and by the monotonicity for $6\nmid N$ the tail $(a_{m+i})_{i\ge1}$ is strictly decreasing, again impossible. Therefore $6\mid a_n$ for every $n$.

Consequently, at any index $n$ exactly one of the following occurs:
- If $v_2(a_n)=1$ and $5\nmid a_n$, then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,6)$ and $a_{n+1}=a_n$.
- If $4\mid a_n$ (and necessarily $5\nmid a_n$ as shown below), then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,4)$ and $a_{n+1}=(13/12)a_n$. In this case $v_2(a_{n+1})=v_2(a_n)-2$ and $v_3(a_{n+1})=v_3(a_n)-1$.
- If $v_2(a_n)=1$ and $5\mid a_n$, then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,5)$ and $a_{n+1}=(31/30)a_n$, with $v_2(a_{n+1})=v_2(a_n)-1$ and $v_3(a_{n+1})=v_3(a_n)-1$.

2) Structural exclusions. Since $6\mid a_n$ for all $n$:
- If $v_2(a_n)=2$, then the three largest proper divisors are $a_n/2,\,a_n/3,\,a_n/4$, which are even, even, odd respectively; hence $a_{n+1}$ is odd, contradicting $6\mid a_{n+1}$. Thus $v_2(a_n)\ne2$ for all $n$.
- If $v_2(a_n)=1$ and $5\mid a_n$, then $a_{n+1}=(31/30)a_n$ is odd (because dividing by $2$ removes the only factor $2$), again impossible. Hence no $a_n$ is divisible by $5$.

3) Necessary conditions on $a_1$. Write $a_1=2^\alpha3^\beta m$ with $\gcd(m,6)=1$.
- From the previous paragraph, every time $4\mid a_n$ we must be in the $13/12$-case, which reduces $v_2$ by $2$. If $\alpha$ were even, repeated $13/12$-steps would inevitably produce a term with $v_2=2$, contradicting the first bullet of (2). Therefore $\alpha$ is odd.
- Starting from $\alpha$ odd and $5\nmid a_n$ for all $n$, we must apply exactly $t=(\alpha-1)/2$ consecutive $13/12$-steps to reach $v_2=1$. Each such step decreases $v_3$ by $1$, and all terms must remain multiples of $6$; hence we need $\beta\ge t+1=(\alpha+1)/2$.
- From the second bullet of (2), $5\nmid a_1$.

Thus any admissible $a_1$ must satisfy
$$
 6\mid a_1,\quad 5\nmid a_1,\quad v_2(a_1)\text{ odd},\quad v_3(a_1)\ge\frac{v_2(a_1)+1}{2}.
$$

4) Sufficiency. Conversely, assume $a_1=2^\alpha3^\beta m$ satisfies $\alpha$ odd, $\beta\ge(\alpha+1)/2$, and $\gcd(m,30)=1$ (so $6\mid a_1$ and $5\nmid a_1$). Then the evolution is forced to perform $t=(\alpha-1)/2$ successive $13/12$-steps, giving
$$
 a_{1+t}=2^{\alpha-2t}3^{\beta-t}m=2^1\,3^{\beta-t}m,
$$
with $\beta-t\ge1$ and still $5\nmid a_{1+t}$. Hence $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,6)$ and $a_{1+t+1}=f(a_{1+t})=a_{1+t}$. The sequence is therefore constant from index $1+t$ onward. Being multiples of $6$, all terms have at least three proper divisors, so the construction meets the requirements.

Conclusion. The set of all possible initial values is
$$
 \Bigl\{a_1\in\mathbb N:\ 6\mid a_1,\ 5\nmid a_1,\ v_2(a_1)\text{ odd, and }v_3(a_1)\ge\tfrac{v_2(a_1)+1}{2}\Bigr\}
 =\bigl\{2^{2t+1}3^s m:\ t\ge0,\ s\ge t+1,\ \gcd(m,30)=1\bigr\}.
$$

Feedback (first flaw):

In Step 2, the conclusion “Hence no a_n is divisible by 5” is not justified: only the case v2(a_n)=1 with 5|a_n is analyzed, while the possibility 5|a_n with v2(a_n)≥2 is neither ruled out nor shown to force a later term with v2=1 that still remains divisible by 5.
