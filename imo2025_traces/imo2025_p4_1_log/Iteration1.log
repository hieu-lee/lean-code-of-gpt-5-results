**Claim.** Let $f(N)$ denote the sum of the three largest proper divisors of $N$. For any positive integer $N$ having at least three proper divisors, write its positive divisors increasingly as $1=d_1<d_2<d_3<d_4<\cdots<d_k=N$. Then
$$
f(N)=\frac N{d_2}+\frac N{d_3}+\frac N{d_4}=N\Big(\frac1{d_2}+\frac1{d_3}+\frac1{d_4}\Big).
$$
Moreover:
- $f(N)=N$ if and only if $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,6)$;
- $f(N)>N$ if $6\mid N$ and $4\mid N$ or $5\mid N$;
- $f(N)<N$ if $6\nmid N$.

**Proof.** Since $d_2,d_3,d_4$ are the three smallest divisors greater than $1$, the three largest proper divisors are their complements $N/d_2,N/d_3,N/d_4$, whence the displayed formula.

If $6\mid N$, then $d_2=2$, $d_3=3$, and $d_4\in\{4,5,6\}$. Hence
$$\frac1{d_2}+\frac1{d_3}+\frac1{d_4}\ge\frac12+\frac13+\frac16=1,$$
with equality exactly when $d_4=6$, i.e., when $4\nmid N$ and $5\nmid N$. If $4\mid N$ (so $d_4\le4$) or $5\mid N$ (so $d_4\le5$), then the sum is $>1$, giving $f(N)>N$.

If $6\nmid N$, either $2\nmid N$ or $3\nmid N$.
- If $2\nmid N$, then $d_2\ge3$, $d_3\ge5$, $d_4\ge7$ (indeed $d_3\ge5$, and if $d_4<7$ then $d_4\in\{3,5\}$ is impossible since $d_2<d_3<d_4$ and $2\nmid N$). Thus
$$\frac1{d_2}+\frac1{d_3}+\frac1{d_4}\le\frac13+\frac15+\frac17=\frac{71}{105}<1,$$
so $f(N)<N$.
- If $2\mid N$ but $3\nmid N$, then $d_2=2$, $d_3\ge4$, $d_4\ge5$; hence
$$\frac1{d_2}+\frac1{d_3}+\frac1{d_4}\le\frac12+\frac14+\frac15=\frac{19}{20}<1,$$
so again $f(N)<N$.
This proves the three bullets. ∎

Now consider any infinite sequence $(a_n)_{n\ge1}$ of positive integers such that each $a_n$ has at least three proper divisors and $a_{n+1}=f(a_n)$ for all $n\ge1$. We determine all possible $a_1$.

First, the equality characterization shows that for any $N$ with $6\mid N$, $4\nmid N$, $5\nmid N$ (equivalently, $v_2(N)=1$, $3\mid N$, $5\nmid N$), one has $f(N)=N$. Hence if $a_1$ is such a number, then $a_n\equiv a_1$ for all $n$, and the sequence is constant and valid.

It remains to show that no other $a_1$ is possible.

Fix such a sequence and let $S=\{n\ge1:6\mid a_n\}$ be the set of indices where $a_n$ is a multiple of $6$. If $S$ were finite, then by the third bullet we would have $a_{n+1}<a_n$ for all sufficiently large $n$, an impossibility for an infinite sequence of positive integers each of which must admit the next term defined from its three largest proper divisors. Thus $S$ is infinite.

Let $m$ be such that $a_m$ is minimal among $\{a_n:n\in S\}$ (well-ordering of $\mathbb N$). We claim that $a_m$ must satisfy $6\mid a_m$, $4\nmid a_m$, $5\nmid a_m$. Suppose not.

1) If $5\mid a_m$ and $4\nmid a_m$, then by the second bullet
$$a_{m+1}=f(a_m)=a_m\Big(\tfrac12+\tfrac13+\tfrac15\Big)=\frac{31}{30}a_m,$$
which is odd (indeed $v_2(a_m)=1$ in this case). Since all proper divisors of an odd integer are odd, every subsequent $a_{m+t}$ is odd. By the third bullet (applied with $2\nmid a_{m+t}$) we have $a_{m+t+1}<a_{m+t}$ for all $t\ge0$, so the sequence strictly decreases forever within the odd numbers, impossible. Hence this case cannot occur.

2) If $4\mid a_m$, consider the 2-adic valuation $v_2(a_m)\ge2$.
- If $v_2(a_m)=2$, then
$$a_{m+1}=f(a_m)=a_m\Big(\tfrac12+\tfrac13+\tfrac14\Big)=\frac{13}{12}a_m,$$
which is odd; the same contradiction as in (1) follows.
- Hence $v_2(a_m)\ge3$. Then $a_{m+1}=\tfrac{13}{12}a_m$ is even and still has at least one factor $2$, while its 3-adic valuation drops by $1$. If now $3\nmid a_{m+1}$, then by the third bullet the next step strictly decreases, and as soon as an odd term appears (which must happen because dividing-by-2 content in the three largest proper divisors cannot persist indefinitely when $3\nmid$ the current term), we reach the contradiction of an infinite strictly decreasing odd tail as in (1).

More directly, quantify this drop as follows. From $a_m$ (with $4\mid a_m$) to the next time the sequence returns to a multiple of $6$, there must be at least one step with $6\nmid a_n$; in each such step, by the third bullet we have the uniform contraction
$$\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\le\frac{19}{20}.$$ 
Starting at $a_m$ one increase by $13/12$ can be offset by two such contractions since
$$\frac{13}{12}\cdot\Big(\frac{19}{20}\Big)^2=\frac{4693}{4800}<1.$$
Therefore, after at most two steps with $6\nmid a_n$ following $a_m$, the value drops strictly below $a_m$. But the first return to a multiple of $6$ after $m$ cannot be below $a_m$ by the minimality of $a_m$ among multiples of $6$. Contradiction.

Combining (1) and (2), we conclude $4\nmid a_m$ and $5\nmid a_m$, whence necessarily $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,6)$ for $a_m$ and thus $f(a_m)=a_m$.

Finally, if $a_1\ne a_m$, then tracing forward from $a_1$ to the first index in $S$ gives either a strict decrease at each interim step (by the third bullet), which cannot pass infinitely many steps while staying positive, or an odd tail as in (1); both are impossible under the problem’s hypothesis that all terms exist and have at least three proper divisors. Hence the only possibility is that $a_1=a_m$ already, i.e., $a_1$ itself satisfies $6\mid a_1$, $4\nmid a_1$, $5\nmid a_1$.

Therefore the set of all possible initial values is precisely
$$\{a_1\in\mathbb N: v_2(a_1)=1,\ 3\mid a_1,\ 5\nmid a_1\}.$$
For every such $a_1$, the sequence is constant ($a_{n+1}=a_n$ for all $n$); conversely, no other $a_1$ can generate an infinite sequence with each term having at least three proper divisors. ∎

Judge #1 Assessment
Decision: REJECT

Feedback (first flaw):

Unjustified assertion: In Case (2) with v2(a_m) ≥ 3, it claims an odd term must eventually appear when 3 ∤ the current term because the 2-adic content “cannot persist indefinitely”; this inevitability is not proved, so the subsequent contradiction is unsupported.
