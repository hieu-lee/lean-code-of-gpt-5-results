\begin{proof}
Let $f(N)$ denote the sum of the three largest proper divisors of $N$. If the positive divisors of $N$ in increasing order are $1=d_1<d_2<d_3<d_4<\cdots<d_k=N$, then the three largest proper divisors are $N/d_2,\,N/d_3,\,N/d_4$, hence
$$
 f(N)=\frac{N}{d_2}+\frac{N}{d_3}+\frac{N}{d_4}=N\Bigl(\frac1{d_2}+\frac1{d_3}+\frac1{d_4}\Bigr).
$$
Basic cases for $6\mid N$:
- If $4\nmid N$ and $5\nmid N$, then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,6)$ and $f(N)=N$.
- If $4\mid N$, then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,4)$ and $f(N)=\tfrac{13}{12}N$.
- If $4\nmid N$ and $5\mid N$, then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,5)$ and $f(N)=\tfrac{31}{30}N$.

If $6\nmid N$, then $f(N)<N$: indeed, if $2\nmid N$ then $d_2\ge3,\,d_3\ge5,\,d_4\ge7$, so $\sum 1/d_i\le1/3+1/5+1/7<1$; if $2\mid N$ but $3\nmid N$, then $d_2=2,\,d_3\ge4,\,d_4\ge5$, so $\sum 1/d_i\le1/2+1/4+1/5<1$.

Claim. If $6\nmid N$, then $6\nmid f(N)$.

Proof of claim. If $2\nmid N$, then all proper divisors are odd, so $f(N)$ is odd. If $2\mid N$ but $3\nmid N$, then $d_2=2$ and none of $d_3,d_4$ is a multiple of $3$. Working modulo $3$ and using that for $x\not\equiv0\pmod3$ one has $x^{-1}\equiv x\pmod3$:
- If $4\mid N$, then $(d_2,d_3)=(2,4)$ so $1/d_2+1/d_3\equiv2+1\equiv0\pmod3$, whereas $d_4\not\equiv0\pmod3$, hence $1/d_2+1/d_3+1/d_4\not\equiv0\pmod3$.
- If $4\nmid N$, then $v_2(N)=1$ and $d_3$ is odd. If $d_4=2d_3$, then $1/d_3+1/d_4\equiv \varepsilon-\varepsilon\equiv0\pmod3$, so $1/d_2+1/d_3+1/d_4\equiv2\not\equiv0$. If $d_4$ is odd, then $1/d_3+1/d_4\in\{0,\pm2\}$ modulo $3$, whence $1/d_2+1/d_3+1/d_4\equiv2,1,\text{ or }4\not\equiv0$. In all cases $3\nmid f(N)$. This proves the claim. $\square$

Now let $(a_n)_{n\ge1}$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers, each with at least three proper divisors, and $a_{n+1}=f(a_n)$.

1) All terms are multiples of $6$. If $6\nmid a_1$, then by the claim $6\nmid a_n$ and by the above monotonicity $a_{n+1}<a_n$ for all $n$, which is impossible for an infinite sequence of positive integers. Thus $6\mid a_1$. If for some $m$ one had $6\mid a_m$ but $6\nmid a_{m+1}$, then by the claim $6\nmid a_{m+i}$ and $a_{m+i+1}<a_{m+i}$ for all $i\ge0$, again impossible. Therefore $6\mid a_n$ for every $n$.

Consequently, at any index $n$ exactly one of the following occurs:
- If $v_2(a_n)=1$ and $5\nmid a_n$, then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,6)$ and $a_{n+1}=a_n$.
- If $4\mid a_n$ (hence $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,4)$), then $a_{n+1}=\tfrac{13}{12}a_n$ and $v_2(a_{n+1})=v_2(a_n)-2$, $v_3(a_{n+1})=v_3(a_n)-1$.
- If $v_2(a_n)=1$ and $5\mid a_n$, then $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,5)$ and $a_{n+1}=\tfrac{31}{30}a_n$ with $v_2(a_{n+1})=v_2(a_n)-1$ and $v_3(a_{n+1})=v_3(a_n)-1$.

2) Structural exclusions.
- $v_2(a_n)\ne2$ for all $n$. Indeed, if $v_2(a_n)=2$, then the three largest proper divisors are $a_n/2,\,a_n/3,\,a_n/4$, which are even, even, and odd respectively; hence $a_{n+1}$ is odd, contradicting $6\mid a_{n+1}$.
- No term is divisible by $5$. Suppose $5\mid a_n$ for some $n$. If $v_2(a_n)=1$, then $a_{n+1}=\tfrac{31}{30}a_n$ is odd, contradicting $6\mid a_{n+1}$. If instead $v_2(a_n)\ge2$, then as long as $v_2\ge2$ we are in the $\tfrac{13}{12}$-case, so $v_2$ drops by $2$ each step, $v_3$ drops by $1$ each step, and $v_5$ stays unchanged. Either we reach $v_2=2$ (then the next term is odd by the previous bullet), or we reach $v_2=1$ while still $5\mid a$ (then the next term is odd by the $\tfrac{31}{30}$-case), or $v_3$ would hit $0$ earlier (then the next term is not divisible by $3$). In every subcase a subsequent term fails to be divisible by $6$, contradicting the conclusion in 1). Hence $5\nmid a_n$ for all $n$.

3) Necessary conditions on $a_1$. Write $a_1=2^\alpha3^\beta m$ with $\gcd(m,6)=1$.
- Every time $4\mid a_n$ we are in the $\tfrac{13}{12}$-case, which reduces $v_2$ by $2$. If $\alpha$ were even, repeated $\tfrac{13}{12}$-steps would inevitably produce a term with $v_2=2$, contradicting the first bullet of (2). Therefore $\alpha$ is odd.
- Starting from $\alpha$ odd and using $5\nmid a_n$ for all $n$, we must apply exactly $t=(\alpha-1)/2$ successive $\tfrac{13}{12}$-steps to reach $v_2=1$. Each such step decreases $v_3$ by $1$, and all terms must remain multiples of $6$; hence we need $\beta\ge t+1=(\alpha+1)/2$.
- From the second bullet of (2), $5\nmid a_1$.

Thus any admissible $a_1$ must satisfy
$$
 6\mid a_1,\quad 5\nmid a_1,\quad v_2(a_1)\text{ odd},\quad v_3(a_1)\ge\frac{v_2(a_1)+1}{2}.
$$

4) Sufficiency. Conversely, assume $a_1=2^\alpha3^\beta m$ satisfies $\alpha$ odd, $\beta\ge(\alpha+1)/2$, and $\gcd(m,30)=1$. Then the evolution performs $t=(\alpha-1)/2$ successive $\tfrac{13}{12}$-steps (since $4\mid a_n$ exactly while $v_2\ge2$ and $5\nmid a_n$ always), giving
$$
 a_{1+t}=2^{\alpha-2t}3^{\beta-t}m=2^1\,3^{\beta-t}m,
$$
with $\beta-t\ge1$ and still $5\nmid a_{1+t}$. Hence $(d_2,d_3,d_4)=(2,3,6)$ and $a_{1+t+1}=f(a_{1+t})=a_{1+t}$. The sequence is therefore constant from index $1+t$ onward. Being multiples of $6$, all terms have at least three proper divisors, so the construction meets the requirements.

Conclusion. The set of all possible initial values is
$$
 \Bigl\{a_1\in\mathbb N:\ 6\mid a_1,\ 5\nmid a_1,\ v_2(a_1)\text{ odd, and }v_3(a_1)\ge\tfrac{v_2(a_1)+1}{2}\Bigr\}
 =\bigl\{2^{2t+1}3^s m:\ t\ge0,\ s\ge t+1,\ \gcd(m,30)=1\bigr\}.
$$

Feedback (first flaw):

Error in the claim’s proof: in the subcase 2|N, 3∤N, 4∤N with d4 odd, the conclusion that 1/d2+1/d3+1/d4 ≠ 0 (mod 3) is false. Indeed, 1/d3+1/d4 can be 1 (mod 3), giving a total of 0 (mod 3) since 1/d2 ≡ 2; for example N=374 has (d2,d3,d4)=(2,11,17) and 1/2+1/11+1/17 ≡ 2+2+2 ≡ 0 (mod 3), so 3 divides f(N).
